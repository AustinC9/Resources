### MVP

By default, the app should **_do something_**

#### Wireframe

![wireframe](link_to_wireframe)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Process

#### Setup

1. Plan out and pseudocode your project - see [example kanban]()
2. [Create GitHub repo (either online or locally)](https://GitHub.com/bootcamp-students/Resources/wiki/Git-Instructions), for example: `my-app`
3. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
4. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
5. Save all and create your first commit to `master`, **then** switch to a `dev` branch

#### Application File Structure

```raw
repo/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        style.css - main stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        main.js - main JavaScript file
    README.md - any important information
    .gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and directories, but you at least need the ones listed above.

#### Develop

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote
6. For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of `dev` onto a `new-feature` branch and create a Pull Request into dev branch when complete

#### Deploy

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Link your `username.github.io` to point to your new project or add it to an existing portfolio in settings
4. Post a link to your GitHub Pages Site to the Projects Slack channel
