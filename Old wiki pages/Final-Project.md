### MVP

By default, your app should use all the technologies learned throughout the bootcamp.

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. JS
5. React
6. Firebase
7. PHP
8. MySQL
9. Laravel
10. Google Cloud

### Process

#### Setup

1. Plan out and pseudocode your project and create a GitHub project Kanban board
2. Create two GitHub repos [**Locally**](https://GitHub.com/bootcamp-students/Resources/wiki/Git-Instructions) via `laravel new my-api` and `npx create-react-app my-ui` to make two framework specific project folders in your main project directory
3. NPM/Composer install and import/route necessary css/js/php libraries (E.g. Bootstrap, Passport)
4. Save all and create your first commit to `master`, **then** switch to a dev branch

#### Application File Structure

- See [create-react-app.dev](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/folder-structure)
- See [Laravel Directory](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/structure)

#### Develop

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote
6. For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of `dev` onto a `new-feature` branch and create a Pull Request into dev branch when complete

#### Deploy

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Link your `username.github.io` to point to your new project or add it to an existing portfolio in settings
4. Push your code from local to either GitHub Pages or Firebase and save the hosting link in your repo description
5. Post a link to your Repo to the Projects Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Create a MVP document with all documentation strategies defined by Agile Software Development
   - Create user personas, user stories, MoSCoW, etc.
   - Design wireframes
   - Design database architecture
   - Add MVP to your projects README.md
2. Create a Full Stack Web App hosted online using all the technologies learned throughout the bootcamp
3. Add your final project to your final portfolio.

#### Additional Requirements

- Website must be responsive
- Website must be styled
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Wiki](https://GitHub.com/bootcamp-students/Resources/wiki/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- Use all critical path built in Laravel features
- Use all critical path built in React features
- Write [Laravel Tests](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/testing)
- Write [React Tests](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html) with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests)
- Learn a new package to add to your existing skills
- Learn a new framework for front end development
- Learn a new framework for back end development
- Continue to maintain your app after the bootcamp ends

#### If you finish early

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.GitHub.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
